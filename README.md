# dobot-tic-tac-toe
This is a python program that enables playing tic-tac-toe with a dobot magician robot arm using the pydobot library.
It features 2 modes:
* Physical mode - place blocks by hand in the real world and the bot will use the webcam taped to the arm in conjunction with the minmax algorhitm to calculate the optimal move
* Virtual mode - place blocks in the sheet and the robot moves the blocks onto the board. No AI involved.

Physical mode is yet to be implemented

Tested and working on arch linux
